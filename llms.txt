# sfsScorer

Scoring tools for commonly used child and youth psychiatric
questionnaires.

## Spit for Science

![](reference/figures/Spit-for-Science-Infographic-2.jpg)

Spit for Science (SFS) was a large population-based study examining
mental health in 40,000 children and youth. The study is one of the
largest to have psychiatric trait and DNA data on a diverse group of
children and youth. As such, it has been used to develop norms for the
psychiatric questionnaires used in the study.

This package allows researchers to automatically score their psychiatric
questionnaires using the SFS norms.
