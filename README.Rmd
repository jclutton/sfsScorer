Scoring tools for commonly used child and youth psychiatric questionnaires.

## Spit for Science

```{r, echo = FALSE, include=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/Spit-for-Science-Infographic-2.jpg')
```

Spit for Science (SFS) was a large population-based study examining mental health in 40,000 children and youth. The study is one of the largest to have psychiatric trait and DNA data on a diverse group of children and youth. As such, it has been used to develop norms for the psychiatric questionnaires used in the study.

This package allows researchers to automatically score their psychiatric questionnaires using the SFS norms.
